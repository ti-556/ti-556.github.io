I'm Tai Inui, a second-year undergraduate student at [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/), majoring in Mechanical Engineering with an expected minor in Computer Science and Communications. I currently belong in [Sugano Laboratory](https://www.sugano.mech.waseda.ac.jp/member.html) and [Tokyo Robotics](https://robotics.tokyo/ja/). My primary passion lies in the field of robotics, particularly robot learning for entertainment.

Throughout my studies, I have immersed myself in machine learning, focusing on deep reinforcement learning and imitation learning. I'm currently working at Tokyo Robotics to implement and fine-tune SOTA AI robot control models to their products, organizing [Kuma Lab](https://www.kuma2024.tech/) as a co-founder, and creating a robot to compete in a bipedal robot fighting competition called [ROBO-ONE](https://www.robo-one.com/). 

My interests revolve around the following topics:
* Robotic Locomotion
* Human-Robot Interaction
* Deep Reinforcement Learning
* Imitation Learning
* Simulations

I'm always eager to connect with like-minded individuals and welcome discussions on any of the topics listed above at any time. Please feel free to reach out from my socialsüçµ
